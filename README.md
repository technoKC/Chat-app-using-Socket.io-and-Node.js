# Chat-app-using-Socket.io-and-Node.js
We will build a web interface for the user to chat through. We will provide text boxes to the user to provide his name and the message that he wants. Then, through the use of socket.io events in Node JS, we will broadcast the messages using our server and display them in the command line or terminal.
